Social Feed
======
**Social Feed** allows the display of a social feed (duh) on your website.

I have not added a Page template for the SocialFeed page type, since I prefer creating my own. However, all the includes are there.

My suggestion is to load the feed with AJAX, so it does not slow the page down.

## Install
Add the following to your composer.json file

```

    "require"          : {
		"milkyway-multimedia/silverstripe-social-feed": "dev-master"
	}

```

### Social Profile Types
Currently only the following are supported:

- Facebook Pages/Profiles
- Twitter Account
- Google Plus Page

I am hoping to add Instagram and maybe Pinterest when I have time... But you can have as many of the above accounts as you want (if you don't mind the lag...)
